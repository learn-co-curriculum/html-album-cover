# HTML Album Cover

This challenge asks that you recreate the album cover shown in the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/MOCKUP.jpg" target="_blank">MOCKUP.jpg</a> image by writing the appropriate HTML neccesary into the index.html page. Use SOURCE.md to copy and paste in all filler text needed.

2. Clone your fork locally.
3. `cd` in the local repo you just cloned.
4. Check out the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/MOCKUP.jpg" target="_blank">MOCKUP.jpg</a> image and take a look at it.
5. Use the comments in the index.html file to create the elements necessary to recreate the album cover shown in <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/MOCKUP.jpg" target="_blank">MOCKUP.jpg</a>. Also use SOURCE.md to copy and paste all neccesary filler text.
